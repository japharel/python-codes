# python-codes

A compilation of all my Python codes I have been doing during the past months.

Many of these codes are just, as I like to call them, "translations" of projects done in Maple (with a few exceptions from Matlab). These were done as part of my studies in geophysics at School of Engineering, UNAM.

As you will find out, the codes are mostly school projects or exercises that I had to code as homework. Many others, are just exercises that I took the time to code just to practice my skills. Until now, I've just uploaded codes done during my first five semesters. As time goes by, I will upload the rest until my eight/ninth semester. Then, I will keep uploading other school projects along with personal projects/codes which will be part of my growth and learning in this world.

Hope you enjoy them!
